### About This Project
I built this website to learn github in a fun and creative way and to have a space to showcase my work and personality.   I got started following [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZ1Hj5yQ-8) and using [this hugo theme](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile).  Having absolutely no web development experience and knowing I wanted to heavily customize this theme, I relied on my :grey_question: problem solving intuition and :mag: Googling skills to learn some basic html and CSS!
