### About This Project
I built this website to learn github in a fun and creative way and to have a place where I can showcase my work/personality!  I got started following [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEZ1Hj5yQ-8) and based my website on this [hugo profile theme](https://hugo-profile.netlify.app/).  Having absolutely no experience with web development and knowing I wanted to heavily customize this theme, I relied on my :bulb: problem solving intuition and :mag_right: Googling skills to learn some basic html and CSS.
