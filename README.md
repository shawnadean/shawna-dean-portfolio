Visit [my portfolio website](https://shawnadean.github.io/shawna-dean-portfolio/) to learn about my past internship experiences, skills, and interests!  

### About This Project
I built this website to (1) learn **GitHub** in a fun and creative way and (2) have a space to showcase my work and personality.  I relied heavily on my :grey_question: problem solving intuition and :mag: Googling skills to pick up some basic **HTML** and **CSS** and fix errors.
