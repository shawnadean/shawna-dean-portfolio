    content: |-
      Hi, I’m Shawna! As an avid mobile zero-based budgeter (shout out [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/features)), I’m passionate about digital tools that help everyday people actively manage their money. I love seeing how these tools enable users to make small steps that turn into big milestones on their personal finance journeys.

      In my work as a Data Analyst and Project Manager for the [UF AIS Consulting Committee](https://www.ufais.org/consulting), I felt a natural pull toward the big-picture mindset and developed my appetite for aligning teams under a shared vision. As an NFCU Branch Ops Sr Business Intelligence Analyst, I discovered my knack for guiding decision-making among cross functional teams & communicating with both empathy and tact.

      I am eager to enter the NFCU digital user experience space to help shape and deliver intuitive solutions that make managing money fun and easy.
